WebGL 2 Examples
================

Rendering algorithms of varying complexity implemented in raw WebGL 2.

Currently include:
- Simple Triangle (Vertex Arrays)
- Phong-shaded Cube (Vertex Arrays, Uniform Buffers)
- Deferred Rendering (Vertex Arrays, Uniform Buffers, Multiple Render Targets, Float Textures, EXT_color_buffer_float)
- Particles (Transform Feedback)
