WebGL 2 Examples
================

Rendering algorithms of varying complexity implemented in raw WebGL 2.

Currently include:
- Simple Triangle (vertex arrays)
- Phong-shaded Cube (vertex arrays, uniform buffers)
- Deferred Rendering (vertex arrays, uniform buffers, multiple render targets, float textures, EXT_color_buffer_float)
- Particles (transform feedback)
